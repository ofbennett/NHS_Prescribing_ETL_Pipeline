This is a cloud based ETL data pipeline which feeds into a web app visualisation. The goals are:

- To provide a way to populate a cloud-based data warehouse in order to make it convenient to run queries and answer any question you might care to ask
- Demontrate how the use of modern data engineering tools and cloud based architecure makes it possible to do interesting things with health-related "Big Data"
